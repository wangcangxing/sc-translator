# Star Citizen Translator (SC Translator)

[简体中文](README.md) | [繁體中文](README_zh-TW.md) | **English**

A **translation toolkit for Star Citizen players** (Windows desktop app): two-way text translation plus on-demand screenshot translation.

- **Understand**: paste foreign text you see in game or in chat (English / Japanese / Korean) → one click to Simplified Chinese
- **Reply**: type your Chinese → translated to English / Japanese / Korean and **auto-copied to the clipboard**, ready to `Ctrl+V` in game
- **Glossary**: `Stanton → 斯坦顿星系`, `Pyro → 派罗星系`, plus 8700+ term pairs mined from the official `global.ini` (locations / vehicles / items / organizations), applied as proper-noun pre-replacement before the model call
- **Spicy mode**: a single toggle that picks the "normal" or the "spicy" prompt set. No auto-detection, no auto-generation. **The spicy prompt explicitly permits real profanity, personal insults and discriminatory content** (it lives in the editable `prompts\translation_spicy.md`; edit it or leave the toggle off if you don't want that)

Translation runs against any **OpenAI-compatible API** (DeepSeek by default). Prompts and glossary are external editable files.

> The UI ships in **Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English** — switch it from the dropdown in the top-right corner, effective immediately.
> Project shape inspired by [ow-translate-lite](https://github.com/reverieach/ow-translate-lite);
> The earlier "real-time screen translation" (polling capture + OCR + overlay) was replaced in **v0.4.0 by
> on-demand screenshot translation**: exactly one frame is captured when you press the hotkey, so the idle
> cost is zero in CPU and nothing is sent to the API unless you ask for it (see the section below).

## Download & run (packaged build)

Get `SCTranslator-v*-win64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/wangcangxing/sc-translator/releases), extract anywhere, double-click `SCTranslator.exe`. No installer, no Python required.

```text
SCTranslator\
  SCTranslator.exe        main program (7 MB)
  _internal\              runtime (includes Qt + RapidOCR models, ~330 MB) — do not delete
  prompts\                prompts (editable, extracted on first run)
  data\                   created on first run: settings / encrypted key / cache / logs
```

- **Portable**: copy the whole folder to another machine and it keeps your settings and logs (all under `data\`)
- **Self-check**: run `SCTranslator.exe --doctor` to verify settings / prompts / glossary / game code table / OCR models / **capture backends**;
  `SCTranslator.exe --doctor --online` additionally performs one real API translation. The report is also written to `data\logs\doctor.log`
- On first launch the app extracts `prompts\` and `data\sc_glossary.ini` from bundled resources if missing (it never overwrites files you edited)

## Getting started

1. **Get an API key**: https://platform.deepseek.com → API Keys (pay-as-you-go; text translation costs very little)
2. In the main window pick provider **DeepSeek** (default base `https://api.deepseek.com`) and paste the key
3. **Understand**: paste foreign text on the left → click **翻译到中文** (or press `Ctrl+Enter`) → the translation appears bottom-right
4. **Reply**: type your Chinese on the right, pick a target language → click **翻译并复制** → the translation is copied to the clipboard, ready to `Ctrl+V` in game
5. Optional: **output checkboxes** (「中文码」/「译文」 in the reply pane) to choose Chinese-to-Chinese, Chinese-to-foreign, or both at once (two lines)
6. Optional: toggle **spicy mode** to switch which prompt set is used for subsequent translations
7. Optional: use the **Language** dropdown in the top-right corner to switch Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English (instant, stored in `data\settings.json`)
8. Optional: **screenshot translation** — press **F10** once to select the text area in game, then press **Shift+F9** any time to "capture once → OCR → translate"; the result goes to three places: ① a quick popup next to the cursor (auto-fades, pinnable/copyable) ② a **persistent overlay** that accumulates the history ③ the main window panes

## Features

- Two-way translation: foreign → Chinese; Chinese → English / Japanese / Korean (auto-copied)
- **On-demand screenshot translation**: press **Shift+F9** to capture a remembered region → local RapidOCR → translate, shown in a floating popup next to the cursor; **F10** re-selects the region. Idle cost is zero (no polling loop, no timed sampling)
- **Trilingual UI**: switch between **Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English** from the top-bar dropdown — applied instantly and remembered
- **Output checkboxes**: zh→zh (`[zh] @code`), zh→foreign, or both (two lines: `[zh] @…` + `[en] …`) — one set in the reply pane, one in the game-chat-code card
- **Game chat code**: Chinese ↔ in-game `@code` (`你好吗` → `[zh] @IH@E8@AP`), so you can actually send Chinese in game chat
- Glossary pre-replacement: 1200+ official EN/ZH pairs (locations / vehicles / items / organizations), fully editable
- **You decide where results go**: the screenshot card has 「Show results in: **Persistent overlay** / **Popup by cursor**」 checkboxes —
  keep either one, or **turn both off**; with both off the result only goes to the main window result panes and you copy it manually
  (no floating window at all, nothing covering the game)
- **Persistent translation overlay** (removed in 0.4.0, wired back in): screenshot results **accumulate** in an always-on-top frame —
  one row per unique line, capped by `max_entries` (default 120, scrolls beyond that). Click-through until you press 「☰ Pin」,
  then drag/resize/right-click menu/「Copy all」; press 「✕」 to hide it and use 「Show overlay」 in the main window to bring it back
  (since v0.4.11 that button sits next to 「Capture & translate」 / 「Select region」 on the screenshot card)
- **Two header styles** (v0.4.11): tick 「Collapse header into a menu」 under *Translation overlay* and the four
  header buttons (capture / spicy / click-through / pin) fold into a single **⋯** menu, leaving only ⋯ and ✕ —
  far less clickable area, so the game cursor is less likely to be "pulled out" when the mouse crosses the overlay
  (**flat is still the default**, so an upgrade changes nothing until you tick it)
- **Reply bar in the overlay**: tick 「Show reply bar in overlay」 to type a Chinese reply right there (Enter to translate, last 8 exchanges kept);
  whether the translation is auto-copied is controlled by the 「Auto-copy reply translations」 toggle (on by default)
- **Reply with the in-game `@code`** (v0.4.11): click **「@code」** on the overlay header (in menu mode: 「Turn the Chinese
  code line on」 inside the ⋯ menu) and one 「Translate」 produces two lines — ``[zh] @code`` + ``[en] translation``
  (Chinese readers parse the code, foreign readers read the translation). With it off you send the foreign text only.
  If this machine has no localized code table, it **falls back to the translation only** and says so on the overlay
- **One-click translate in the overlay** (v0.4.10): the overlay carries a **🎯 Translate** button — in the pinned
  header, and on the small always-visible chip while click-through (the default). When the global hotkey does not
  respond in game, click it to capture & translate; afterwards the app **hands the foreground back to the game** so
  your keyboard control returns immediately
- **Sentences are no longer split apart** (v0.4.10): wrapped chat lines are merged back into one message before
  translation; glued English (`takedisable` → `take disable`) is split first; the `[channel] Player:` prefix is never
  run through the glossary — a player named `Cpt_Andromeda` stays `Cpt_Andromeda` (not 「Cpt_仙女座」)
- Spicy mode toggle (normal ⇄ spicy prompt sets, user-editable)
- Translation cache + multi-line batched requests + `Ctrl+Enter`, repeated text is never billed twice
- **Full error logging**: startup crashes / uncaught exceptions / Qt warnings go to `data\logs\startup.log`;
  the 「日志」 button opens the log folder; `data\logs\exchange.log` records every "input → model output" pair (handy when debugging empty content or mojibake)
- API key encrypted with Windows DPAPI — only your Windows user on this machine can decrypt it
- Dark & light themes, single-instance lock, portable layout

## Game chat code (getting Chinese into in-game chat)

Star Citizen's chat box cannot type Chinese, but the game's **localization syntax `@KEY` expands to that key's value**.
The community's trick is to register 7020 common Chinese characters as localization keys in `global.ini`
(key name = character index in base36); typing `@IH@E8@AP` in chat renders as 「你好吗」. This tool implements that path:

- **Encode**: type Chinese on the left → instantly get `[zh] @IH@E8@AP` → auto-copied → `Ctrl+V` in game
- **Decode**: paste someone's `[zh] @…` on the right → **decode back to Chinese** (the original community tool has no reverse direction)
- Code table source: auto-detected from the **localized `global.ini` already installed on your machine**
  (`…\StarCitizen\LIVE\data\Localization\chinese_(simplified)\global.ini`), or pick it manually via 「浏览…」;
  the status line shows table size and version
- The resolved path is stored in `data\settings.json` (`gamecode_ini_path`), so later launches skip the disk scan (first detection ≈ 0.1 s)

> **Requirement**: a Chinese localization pack that includes "community input method support" must be installed
> (e.g. checked when installing the localization in SC 汉化盒子, or the block is already present in your `global.ini`).
> Without it the feature shows a hint and the rest of the app keeps working.

Implementation notes (`sc_translator/gamecode.py`):

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Code table block | the `code=character` lines in `global.ini` between `_…_community_input_method_version=` and `_…_localization_version=` |
| Code | the character's index in the table, base36 (`0-9A-Z`, min 2 chars): `IH`=665=你, `E8`=512=好, `AP`=385=吗 |
| ASCII / punctuation | passed through verbatim, separated from codes by a space (`Pyro 见 @Bob` → `[zh] Pyro @31 @Bob`) |
| Uncovered characters | dropped to a single space (same as the original implementation) |
| Decode safety | encoding invariants are enforced, so player handles like `@Bob` are never split into bogus codes |

**Output checkboxes** (one pair in the reply pane, one in the game-code card; independent):

| Chinese code | Foreign / translation | Output | Needs API |
| :---: | :---: | --- | --- |
| ☑ | ☐ | `[zh] @IH@E8@AP` (zh→zh: Chinese only) | no (fully local) |
| ☐ | ☑ | `How are you` (zh→foreign) | yes |
| ☑ | ☑ | `[zh] @IH@E8@AP` ↲ `[en] How are you` (both audiences) | yes |

- **At least one** box must stay checked; unchecking the last one re-checks it and tells you
- In the reply pane the "translation" follows the target language (English/Japanese/Korean) and the marker becomes `[en]` / `[ja]` / `[ko]`
- Choices persist in `data\settings.json` (`reply_out_code` / `reply_out_foreign`, `gamecode_out_code` / `gamecode_out_en`)
- Without a code table: "Chinese code only" points you at installing the localization; "code + translation" silently falls back to translation only — never a half-finished message
- On API failure or a missing key it degrades to the Chinese code line, so the message still gets out

## UI language (Simplified / Traditional Chinese / English)

Use the dropdown in the top-right corner: the window is rebuilt immediately, no restart needed, and the
choice is stored as `ui_language` in `data\settings.json`.

- The string table lives in `sc_translator/i18n.py`: **one key per row, three languages as a tuple**, so a
  missing translation is structurally impossible; `tests/test_i18n.py` asserts all three locales are
  complete, that the English strings contain no Chinese, and that Traditional differs from Simplified
- Adding a string is one tuple; a missing/empty entry falls back to Simplified Chinese and then to the key itself
- Switching is refused while a translation is in flight (so callbacks cannot hit destroyed widgets) and the status line says so
- Provider **display names** follow the language, while the **stored value** stays a stable key
  (`DeepSeek`/`OpenAI`/`custom`); settings that stored a legacy display name are migrated automatically

## Screenshot translation (on-demand hotkey, no continuous scanning)

When you hit English UI text, a mission briefing or chat you cannot read, just press a hotkey — the app
captures **exactly one frame** at that moment. There is no polling thread and no timed sampling, so the
idle cost is zero in CPU and in tokens.

| Hotkey (configurable) | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Shift+F9** | Capture the remembered region → local RapidOCR → translate to Chinese → floating popup + main-window result pane |
| **F10** | Re-select the capture region (also used on first run) |

- **Recognition**: local RapidOCR (PaddleOCR onnx models ship with the app; fully offline, no cost)
- **Translation**: your configured API, sharing the glossary and cache with text translation
  (`Stanton System` → 斯坦顿星系, `Pyro` → 派罗星系)
- **Timing**: about 3 s after startup the OCR model is **pre-warmed in the background** (v0.4.10), so even the first
  press does not wait for the model (pre-warm takes ~0.4-0.5 s and costs ~+75 MB resident); afterwards each press takes
  roughly **2-6 s** (OCR 0.3-0.5 s + translation 1-2 s)
- **Settings** (v0.4.9): the **⚙ Settings** button (top right) opens a dialog holding provider/API key/model,
  the SC glossary, screenshot hotkeys, OCR acceleration and image-reading, where results go, the overlay,
  UI language and log access — the main window keeps only translation and capture controls
- **Faster** (v0.4.9): the OCR detection size is tuned to your framed region (measured **-38%**); pressing the
  hotkey twice on an unchanged frame reuses the previous result (**0.005 s**); `/models` is no longer probed and
  the connection no longer rebuilt on every press (saves **2-4.5 s**); the recognized text appears first and is
  replaced in place when the translation arrives
- **GPU acceleration (DirectML)** (toggle in Settings): OCR measured **0.48 s -> 0.09 s (~5x)** with a flat
  ~200 MB of VRAM that is released when switched off. The packaged build already bundles the runtime; for source
  runs install `pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps onnxruntime-directml`
- **Let the model read the image** (optional, toggle in Settings): sends the framed crop straight to the
  multimodal model (e.g. `deepseek-flash`), which recognizes and translates in one call and uses **no local
  CPU/VRAM**; the trade-off is that **the screenshot is uploaded** and image tokens are billed (official cap:
  1024 per image)
- **Popup**: appears next to the cursor, auto-avoids screen edges, fades after 8 s (configurable/pinnable);
  hovering pauses the countdown; "Copy all" puts "source → translation" on the clipboard
- **Guard rail**: at most 40 lines per capture (configurable) so a mis-dragged full-screen region cannot burn tokens;
  numeric-only, punctuation-only and single-character lines are dropped
- **Graceful failure**: if translation fails (no credit/offline) the recognized source text is still shown
- **Requirement**: run Star Citizen **windowed / borderless**; exclusive fullscreen DX frames may not be capturable

> Size note: OCR needs `onnxruntime + opencv + rapidocr` plus model files, which grows the bundle from
> 120 MB to about **330 MB** (zip ~150 MB). They are **lazy-loaded**: nothing is loaded or kept resident until
> you press the hotkey. See the comments at the top of `SCTranslator.spec` to build a slim variant instead.

## Prompt files (editable)

Prompts are not hard-coded; they live under `prompts\` next to the program (`.md` / `.txt` plain text):

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `prompts\translation_normal.md` | normal translation prompt. `{src}`→source language, `{target}`→target language |
| `prompts\translation_spicy.md` | extra prompt appended when spicy mode is on |
| `prompts\reply.md` | reply translation prompt. `{target}`→English/Japanese/Korean |

- **Restart the app** after editing; HTML comments `<!-- … -->` and lines starting with `#` are stripped and never sent
- Missing/broken files fall back to built-in defaults; the `SC_PROMPTS_DIR` environment variable can point elsewhere

## Glossary (proper-noun pre-replacement)

`data\sc_glossary.ini`, one `English=Chinese` pair per line; add or remove freely:

```ini
Stanton=斯坦顿星系
Pyro=派罗星系
Area18=18 区
```

Matching is **case-insensitive with word boundaries**, multi-word entries win; if no path is configured the bundled table is used.
(Set `glossary_enabled` to false in `data\settings.json` to disable it entirely.)

> For chat lines (screenshot translation / game chat) only the text **after the colon** is replaced: the
> `[channel] Player:` prefix is left untouched, so a player named `Cpt_Andromeda` or `Pyro` is never translated
> into Chinese (since v0.4.10).

## Run from source

Windows 10/11 x64 + Python 3.10+.

```powershell
# Option A: double-click run.bat (creates the venv and installs deps on first run, 1-3 min)
# Option B: manually
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m sc_translator
```

## Build your own exe

```powershell
# double-click build.bat, or:
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m PyInstaller --noconfirm --clean SCTranslator.spec
# output: dist\SCTranslator\SCTranslator.exe (onedir, ~120 MB including Qt)
```

The bundle only contains what text translation needs: PySide6 (Core/Gui/Widgets) + requests.
OCR / local models / imaging (numpy, opencv, onnxruntime, llama-cpp …) are all excluded, which keeps both size and startup time small (cold start ≈ 1 s).
`tests/test_packaging.py` guards that boundary: if a heavy dependency ever enters the import graph, the test fails.

Publishing to GitHub: double-click `publish.bat` (sets origin → pushes `main` → copies the release notes to the clipboard and opens the release page),
then drop `dist\SCTranslator-v0.4.5-win64.zip` into the release attachments.

## Configuration & data

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `data\settings.json` | all settings (provider / model / spicy mode / glossary toggles …) |
| `data\api_key.bin` | DPAPI-encrypted API key |
| `data\cache.json` | translation cache |
| `data\sc_glossary.ini` | glossary (extracted on first run of the portable build) |
| `data\logs\startup.log` | startup/crash log (`run.bat` shows its tail on failure) |
| `data\logs\sc_translator.log` | runtime log |
| `data\logs\exchange.log` | input/output exchange log (time / kind / model / style / input / output or error) |
| `data\logs\doctor.log` | `--doctor` self-check report |

- The data directory defaults to **`data\` next to the program** (portable); `SC_TRANSLATOR_HOME` overrides it
- Legacy `%APPDATA%\SCTranslator` data is migrated automatically on first run
- Single instance only; if a restart within 15 s says "already running", delete `data\instance.lock`

## FAQ

- **Clicking translate does nothing / missing key**: fill in the API key first; `SCTranslator.exe --doctor` pinpoints the problem
- **"model returned empty content (HTTP 200)"**: this is **thinking mode** — DeepSeek models enable thinking **by default**
  (effort defaults to `high`), so the reasoning chain eats the output budget of a short translation request and `content`
  comes back empty at HTTP 200. The app now automatically: ① sends `{"thinking":{"type":"disabled"}}` for `deepseek*`
  models; ② retries once with thinking disabled if content is still empty; ③ raises the per-line output budget floor to
  256; ④ reports `finish_reason` and `reasoning_tokens` in the error when both attempts are empty. Measured on the same
  sentence: 85 output tokens without the flag vs **7** with `disabled`. See `docs\参考-DeepSeek思考模式.md`
- **Nothing appears / it fails to start**: check `data\logs\startup.log` and `sc_translator.log`; from source, run `python -m sc_translator` in a terminal to see the error
- **Translations not good enough**: edit the prompts under `prompts\`, or add terms to `data\sc_glossary.ini`, then restart
- **Spicy mode**: purely a prompt switch; it affects subsequent translations immediately
- **Cost**: identical text hits the cache and is never re-sent; typical text-chat usage costs a few cents per day
